### __Analysis and Conclusion:__

The most and least streamed artist on Spotify are The Weeknd and Carin Leon, respectively. The bpm, beats per minute, of songs in the data range from 60 to 210 bpm. The most common range of bpm is from 60 to 120 bpm. There is no linear correlation between the song’s popularity and its danceability, but the plots do show denser collection of points higher up on the chart position and around 60% - 80% danceability. This is supported by the average danceability of about 67%-68% for each platform: Spotify, Apple, Shazam, and Deezer. The year with the most streams is 1975 is 1975 with over 2 billion streams and the year with the least amount of streams is 1930 with 90 million streams. Songs from 2020-2023 all have less than 1 million streams. A song’s popularity may build over time as more and more people add songs into their regular rotation once they discover new music. This is a possibility of why newer songs has less streams than those that are more than 5 years old.
